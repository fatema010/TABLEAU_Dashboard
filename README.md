## Project Details

- **Motivation:** The project aims to leverage Tableau's data visualization capabilities to create informative and interactive dashboards
  that enable data-driven insights.

- **Dashboard:** The main deliverable is an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows users to explore data and uncover patterns visually.

- **Language:** Tableau

## Dataset

- **Source:** The project utilizes a dataset containing relevant data for visualization.
   The dataset may include various dimensions, measures, and timestamps.


## Dashboard Creation

- The dashboard is created within Tableau Desktop using a drag-and-drop interface, allowing for easy arrangement of visual elements.

- Multiple visualizations and components (e.g., charts, maps, filters) can be added to the dashboard canvas.

## Visualizations

- Visualizations may include bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, heat maps, and more, depending on the dataset and insights to be conveyed.

- Color coding, annotations, and labels enhance the interpretability of the visualizations.

## Interactivity

- Filters, parameters, and actions can be added to the dashboard to enable interactivity.

- Users can filter data dynamically, drill down into specific dimensions, and see visualizations update in real time.
